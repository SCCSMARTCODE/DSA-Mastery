# **Bubble Sort in C++, C and Python**

## **Introduction**
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the list is sorted. It is a fundamental algorithm for beginners to understand sorting and basic algorithmic concepts.

This project will guide you through implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm from scratch, testing it on various cases, and validating the correctness of the sort.

---

## **Project Overview**
In this project, you will:
1. Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
2. Create a helper function to check if an array is sorted.
3. Write test cases to validate the sorting function on different types of arrays.

## **Steps to Implement Bubble Sort**

### **1. Understanding Bubble Sort**
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly:
- Comparing adjacent elements in the array.
- Swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
- After each pass, the largest unsorted element is placed in its correct position.
- The process continues until no swaps are needed, which means the array is sorted.

### **2. Project Structure**
In this project, you will need:
- A function to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- A function to display the array before and after sorting.
- A function to check if the array is sorted correctly.

### **3. Main Components**

**Pseudocode for Main File**


1. **Function Definitions**:
    - : Sorts the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
    - : Checks if the array is sorted correctly.
    - : Prints the array elements.

2. **Main Logic**:
    - Declare and initialize an array (or list) .
    - Display the original array.
    - Call  to sort the array.
    - Display the sorted array.
    - Check if the array is sorted correctly using .
    - Display whether the sorting was successful.

### **What You Should Do**:
1. Implement the , , and  functions in C, C++, or Python.
2. Make sure the logic in the pseudocode is reflected in your actual implementations for each language.

---

### **Explanation of Each Step**:
- ****: Loops through the array, repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements until the array is sorted.
- ****: Checks if the elements in the array are in non-decreasing order.
- ****: Simply prints each element of the array to the console.

By following this pseudocode, you can implement the same logic in any programming language—C, C++, or Python—and provide solutions for each in your repository.


### **4. Testing**
Make sure to write your own test cases and check if your  function works properly on various arrays, such as:
- Random unsorted arrays.
- Already sorted arrays.
- Reverse sorted arrays.
- Arrays with negative numbers or duplicates.

## **Learning Outcomes**
By the end of this project, you will:
1. **Understand the Bubble Sort algorithm**: How it works and its performance characteristics.
2. **Improve problem-solving skills**: By implementing the algorithm from scratch.
3. **Test your implementation**: You will learn how to validate sorting algorithms using test cases.

4. **Expected Output**:
   After running the program, you should see something like this:

## **Further Improvements**
Once you have successfully implemented and tested Bubble Sort, consider improving the project by:
- Adding more test cases.
- Measuring the time taken by the algorithm to sort larger arrays.
- Comparing the performance of Bubble Sort with more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
