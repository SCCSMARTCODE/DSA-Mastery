# **Flash Sort in C++, C, and Python**

## **Introduction**

**Flash Sort** is a distribution sorting algorithm that is particularly effective for sorting large arrays of numbers. It combines the advantages of both partitioning and insertion methods, achieving better performance than comparison-based sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Flash Sort is most efficient when the input data is uniformly distributed.

### **Key Characteristics**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) on average, but can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the storage of auxiliary data structures.
- **Stable**: No, it does not maintain the relative order of equal elements.
- **In-place**: Partially; it uses extra space for auxiliary arrays but is more space-efficient compared to some algorithms.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, you will:
1. Implement the **Flash Sort** algorithm from scratch.
2. Understand how the algorithm distributes elements into classes and sorts them.
3. Test the algorithm on various integer arrays to ensure its functionality.

---

## **Understanding Flash Sort**

### **How It Works**:
1. **Class Creation**: The array is divided into a fixed number of classes based on the range of values.
2. **Distribution**: Each element is assigned to a class based on its value.
3. **Insertion**: Each class is sorted using a simple algorithm (like insertion sort) once the distribution phase is complete.
4. **Concatenation**: The sorted classes are then concatenated to form the final sorted array.

Flash Sort is efficient for large datasets because it minimizes comparisons and leverages the properties of distribution.

## **Project Structure**

For this project, you will need:
1. **Flash Sort Function** (`flashSort`): The main function to implement the Flash Sort logic.
2. **Helper Functions** (`displayArray`): A function to print the array before and after sorting.
3. **Main Program**: The driver code to test your Flash Sort implementation.

## **Main Components**

### **Pseudocode for the Project**

```plaintext
FUNCTION flashSort(arr):
    n = length(arr)
    minVal = findMin(arr)
    maxVal = findMax(arr)
    numClasses = determineNumberOfClasses()
    classSize = (maxVal - minVal) / numClasses

    DECLARE classes AS ARRAY OF SIZE numClasses
    INITIALIZE classes TO EMPTY LISTS

    # Distributing elements into classes
    FOR i FROM 0 TO n - 1:
        index = (arr[i] - minVal) / classSize
        APPEND arr[i] TO classes[index]
    
    # Sorting each class using insertion sort
    FOR each class IN classes:
        insertionSort(class)

    # Concatenating sorted classes back into arr
    index = 0
    FOR each class IN classes:
        FOR each element IN class:
            arr[index] = element
            index = index + 1

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION insertionSort(class):
    FOR i FROM 1 TO length(class) - 1:
        key = class[i]
        j = i - 1
        WHILE j >= 0 AND class[j] > key:
            class[j + 1] = class[j]
            j = j - 1
        class[j + 1] = key
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION displayArray(arr):
    FOR EACH element IN arr:
        PRINT element
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

MAIN FUNCTION:
    DECLARE arr AS [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]

    PRINT "Original array: "
    CALL displayArray(arr)

    CALL flashSort(arr)

    PRINT "Sorted array: "
    CALL displayArray(arr)
END MAIN FUNCTION
```

## **Implementations**

You can implement Flash Sort in the following languages:
- [C++ Code](./flashsort.cpp)
- [C Code](./flashsort.c)
- [Python Code](./flashsort.py)

Each language will follow the same logic and pseudocode, ensuring consistency across implementations.

## **Testing**

### **Test Cases**
Make sure to test your Flash Sort implementation with different types of arrays:
1. **Random unsorted arrays**: `[34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]`
2. **Already sorted arrays**: `[5, 23, 34, 32, 62]`
3. **Reverse sorted arrays**: `[62, 34, 32, 23, 7, 5]`
4. **Arrays with duplicates**: `[5, 7, 5, 34, 7, 62]`

### **Expected Output**
For the input array `[34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]`, the output after sorting should look like:

```plaintext
Original array: 34 7 23 32 5 62 
Sorted array: 5 7 23 32 34 62 
```

## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this project, you will:
1. **Understand the Flash Sort algorithm**: Learn its distribution-based approach and how it achieves linear time complexity on average.
2. **Implement an efficient sorting algorithm**: Gain experience in creating a sorting algorithm that is faster than many traditional sorting methods under certain conditions.
3. **Test sorting algorithms**: Learn how to validate your Flash Sort implementation by running it on various test cases and verifying the results.

## **Further Improvements**

Once you have implemented Flash Sort, consider exploring:
1. **Performance testing**: Measure the performance of Flash Sort on larger datasets and compare it with other sorting algorithms.
2. **Edge case handling**: Improve your implementation to handle edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with only one element.
3. **Adaptive modifications**: Explore modifications to make Flash Sort more adaptable to different input distributions.
